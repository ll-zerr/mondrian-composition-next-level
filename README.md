# Mondrian Composition Next Level

This is a Mondrian composition with greater complexity (more shapes and colors) compared to the Mondrian Painting project in the [Udemy course The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING).

## Project Details

The goal of the project is to create a Mondrian style composition of increased difficulty using CSS Grid.

## Features

- Painting is centered in the browser using flexbox.
- The painting has six colors displayed in various sizes.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## My Process

- Start the file from a boiler template.
- Create the divs for the shapes required and the grid-container in HTML.
- Add styles for the grid container and applicable colors for each div.
- Modify each div utilizing grid tracks to the correct size with the keyword `span`.
- Add styles to center the painting in the browser.

### Continued development

I thoroughly enjoyed creating this Mondrian composition using only a visual image as my reference. I specifically chose this particular composition as it has a more complex layout to it with an additional color, which I felt would challenge my CSS grid skills. There were no dimensions provided for the project, allowing me to utilize my analytical skills when creating the columns and rows. I hope to continue to apply these skills in future projects.
